# PyQT stickers note app

## version 1.0 
the app allows you to create notes and drag them all over the window

## Steps I followed to make this app
-created a new window in designer
-draged and dropped buttons, edit text...etc
-generated a py code version of the gui.ui('gui' is the name of the gui code) using : pyuic5 gui.ui > gui.py ( link: https://www.codementor.io/deepaksingh04/design-simple-dialog-using-pyqt5-designer-tool-ajskrd09n)
-created a notes.py that will contain all the logic
-imported the gui.ui and all the other qt modules and also sql modules
-created the db and set fieds (rows and colums)
-set different actions for buttons, mouse events ...
-styled the app
